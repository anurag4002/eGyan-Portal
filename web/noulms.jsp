			Under the collaborative venture the AINU will offer participating universities the opportunity to
			twin with institutions in India and ASEAN. With its region-specific concerns, this initiative will stimulate knowledge sharing, and eventually
			lead to the creation of a common resource pool, for India and ASEAN Member States. This would offer opportunities for exchange of skills, competence, best practices and knowhow.

        <p>Located in the town of Rajgir, in the northern Indian state of Bihar, Nalanda is a postgraduate, research-intensive, international university supported 
            by the participating countries of the East Asia Summit. The University came into being on November 25, 2010 by a special Act of the Indian Parliament 
            and has been designated as an “institution of national importance”.<br/></p>
<p class="pt-4">Nalanda is inspired by the academic excellence and global vision of its historic predecessor and aspires to meet and set global standards of academic excellence
and research and enable capacity building in all areas of higher learning. The University is being supported by all the Member States of the East Asia Summit and 
Intergovernmental Memorandums of Understanding to that effect have been signed by 17 countries.</p><br/>
The University seeks to recover the lost connections and partnerships that existed in the region called Asia, before the onset of historical forces that led to 
their dissolution. Asian cultures have multiple links that go deep into the past and are reflected in a variety of common cultural features. The re-discovery of
inter-Asian linkages in recent times has led to a resurgence in discovering and building upon a shared history. Nalanda University
is envisaged as an icon of this new Asian renaissance: a creative space that will be for future generations a center of inter-civilizational dialogue.
